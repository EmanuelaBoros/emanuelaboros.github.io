## Background

I received my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (2018) from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France, where my [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01943841/document) proposed several neural architectures for event extraction from unstructured text.  

Before that, I earned:
- an **M.Sc.** in *Software Engineering* and a **B.Sc.** in *Computer Science* from [Alexandru I. Cuza University](https://www.uaic.ro/en), Iași, Romania  
- an **M.A.** and **B.A.** in *Visual Arts (video & photography)* from the [George Enescu National University of Arts](https://www.arteiasi.ro/?page_id=1144&lang=eng), Iași, Romania  

During my Ph.D., I spent three years at:
- [CEA, List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) (Laboratory for Integration of Systems and Technology)  
- [LIMSI (now LISN)](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) in Orsay, France  

I then worked as a **research engineer** at the [LAL](https://www.lal.in2p3.fr/en/) (Linear Accelerator Laboratory), within the [Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/), focusing on **NLP applications for French law** (case outcome prediction) and **fake news detection**.  

From 2017 to 2019, I joined [Teklia](https://teklia.com/) as a **Machine Learning Scientist**, developing technologies for **digitised and historical document understanding**, including **handwriting recognition**, **article separation**, and **named entity recognition**.  

From 2020 to 2022, I worked as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [University of La Rochelle](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/?lang=en), within the **L3i Laboratory (IT, Image & Interaction)**.  

My main research interests include:
- **Information extraction** — entities, relations, and events  
- **Digitised and historical documents**  
- **Multilingual and multimodal learning**  
- **Machine learning for cultural heritage data**

## Fun facts

* Currently signed in to 30 different Slack teams.
* Don't believe in fantasy books, but can dream up neural architectures that read medieval charters.
* Once built a pipeline that processed 40 million historical newspaper articles — and still found time to watch movies and go to metal festivals.
* Known to advance the state of the art by gently correcting it. _"Sometimes the most important discoveries are about what doesn’t work."_ (Mikhail Biriuchinskii, Lisbon, DH2025)
* __When Ema joins a shared task, everyone updates their baselines.__
