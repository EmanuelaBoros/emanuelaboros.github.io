Hello â€” Iâ€™m Ema, a research scientist with a background in both **computer science** and **art**, which shapes the way I approach research, creativity, and problem-solving. While my main focus today is on **natural language processing (NLP)** and **historical document analysis**, I also studied **video and photography** â€” two practices that continue to influence how I see patterns, identity, and representation.  

Outside of research, youâ€™ll likely find me at a **metal festival**, camping, gardening or watching **films and series** and reading **non-fantasy books**.  

I value **listening, clarity, and thoughtful action** â€” speaking with purpose, avoiding unnecessary repetition, and following through. My humor tends to be dry and irreverent ðŸ¥´ â€” somewhere between **Bukowski** and **Ricky Gervais** â€” blunt, honest, and usually funny in its own way ðŸ™ƒ.
