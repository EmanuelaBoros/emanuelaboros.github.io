Hello â€” Iâ€™m Ema, a [Research Scientist at DHLAB (Digital Humanities Laboratory), EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/emanuela.boros?lang=en) in Lausanne, Switzerland.  

I have a background in both **computer science** and **art**, which shapes the way I approach research, creativity, and problem-solving. While my main focus today is on **natural language processing (NLP)** and **historical document analysis**, I also studied **video and photography** â€” two practices that continue to influence how I see patterns, identity, and representation.  

Outside of research, youâ€™ll likely find me at a **metal festival**, camping, or watching **films and series** (always) and reading **non-fantasy books** (sometimes).  

I value **listening, clarity, and thoughtful action** â€” speaking with purpose, avoiding unnecessary repetition, and following through. My humor tends to be dry and irreverent ðŸ¥´ â€” somewhere between **Bukowski** and **Ricky Gervais** â€” blunt, honest, and usually funny in its own way.

## Current Position

At EPFLâ€™s DHLAB, Iâ€™ve been contributing to the development of machine learning and NLP technologies for large-scale cultural data. Over time, my responsibilities shifted more toward engineering and infrastructure, which I continue to enjoy as an integral part of research. But I've come to realize that I thrive most in roles with a strong research and collaborative component â€” environments that foster exploration, creativity, and exchange.

ðŸ‘‰ **As of early 2026, Iâ€™m open to new opportunities** â€” particularly roles involving **NLP**, **digital humanities**, or **deep learning for cultural and historical data**. If my profile aligns with your teamâ€™s needs, feel free to reach out.
