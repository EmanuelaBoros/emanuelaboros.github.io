Hello — I’m Ema, a [Research Scientist at DHLAB (Digital Humanities Laboratory), EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/emanuela.boros?lang=en) in Lausanne, Switzerland.  

I have a background in both **computer science** and **art**, which shapes the way I approach research, creativity, and problem-solving. While my main focus today is on **natural language processing (NLP)** and **historical document analysis**, I also studied **video and photography** — two practices that continue to influence how I see patterns, identity, and representation.  

Outside of research, you’ll likely find me at a **metal festival**, camping, or watching **films and series** (always) and reading **non-fantasy books** (sometimes).  

I value **listening, clarity, and thoughtful action** — speaking with purpose, avoiding unnecessary repetition, and following through. My humor tends to be dry and irreverent — somewhere between **Bukowski** and **Ricky Gervais** — blunt, honest, and usually funny in its own way.

## Current Position

At EPFL’s DHLAB, I’ve been contributing to the development of **machine learning and NLP technologies for large-scale cultural data**. Although my position here gradually evolved toward **engineering and infrastructure** rather than **engineering, infrastructure, research and collaboration**, it has reinforced my interest in returning to a **research-oriented environment** where exploration, creativity, and exchange are central.

👉 **As of early 2026, I’m open to new opportunities** — particularly roles involving **NLP**, **digital humanities**, or **deep learning for cultural and historical data**.  
If my profile aligns with your team’s needs, feel free to reach out.
