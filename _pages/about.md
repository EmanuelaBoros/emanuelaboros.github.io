Hello, I’m Ema — a [research scientist at DHLAB (Digital Humanities Laboratory), EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/emanuela.boros?lang=en) in Lausanne, Switzerland.  

I have a background in both **computer science and art**, which shapes the way I approach research, creativity, and problem-solving. While my main focus today is on **natural language processing (NLP)** and historical document analysis, I also studied video and photography — two practices that continue to influence how I see patterns, identity, and representation.  

Outside of research, I’m usually at a **metal festival**, camping, or watching **movies and series** (always) and sometimes reading non-fantasy books. 

Generally, I value **listening, clarity, and thoughtful action** — I believe in speaking with purpose, without unnecessary repetition, and following through. Harsh this sentence, ain't it? Yes, my humor is Bukowski-like at times, George Carlin-like at others — dry, blunt, and a little irreverent, but usually funny in its honesty.

My background
======

I received my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** in 2018 from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France, specializing in **natural language processing (NLP)**. My [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01943841/document) proposed several neural network architectures for extracting events from unstructured text.  

Before that, I earned an **M.Sc. in Software Engineering** and a **B.Sc. in Computer Science** from the [Alexandru I. Cuza University, Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.uaic.ro/en), Iași, Romania. In parallel, I also pursued my interest in the arts, completing both an **M.A. and B.A. in Visual Arts (video & photography)** at the [George Enescu National University of Arts](https://www.arteiasi.ro/?page_id=1144&lang=eng), Iași, Romania.  

During my Ph.D., I spent three years at [CEA, List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) (Laboratory for Integration of Systems and Technology) and [LIMSI (now LISN)](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/), both in Orsay, France. I then worked for a year as a **research engineer** at the [LAL](https://www.lal.in2p3.fr/en/) (Linear Accelerator Laboratory) within the [Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/). My work there focused on **NLP applications in French law** (case outcome prediction) and **fake news detection**.  

From 2017 to 2019, I joined [Teklia](https://teklia.com/) as a **machine learning scientist**, where I developed technologies for **digitised and historical document understanding**, including handwriting recognition, article separation, and named entity recognition.  

In 2020, I returned to academia as a **postdoctoral researcher** at the [University of La Rochelle](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/?lang=en), in the L3i (IT, Image and Interaction) Laboratory, where I worked until the end of 2022.  

My main research interest is **information extraction** — entities, relations, and events — from **digitised documents**, at the intersection of NLP, machine learning, and cultural data.
